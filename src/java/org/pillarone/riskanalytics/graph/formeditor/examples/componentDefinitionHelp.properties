org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.Aggregator=Component for aggregating claims of type <code>ClaimPacket</code>. Any number of links can be connected to the <code>inClaims</code>-port, each sending an arbitrary number of <code>ClaimPacket</code>. For further information see the <a href="http://www.pillarone.org/">javadoc</a>-entries. <h4>See also:</h4><a href="resourceKey:org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.Adder">Adder</a>

org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.AggregateNormalClaimGenerator=Generator for aggregate claims. <br>If the <code>inFrequency</code>-port is connected it generated <code>n</code> independent identically distributed claims and writes its sum to the <code>outClaim</code>-port. The number <code>n</code> is obtained by summing all the frequencies received at the <code>inFrequency</code>-port in a given iteration.<br>If the <code>inFrequency</code>-port is not connected one single claims is generated and written to the <code>outClaim</code>-port. <br>In either case, a Normal distribution is used to generated the claims. <h4>See also:</h4><a href="resourceKey:org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.SingleClaimsGenerator">SingleClaimsGenerator</a>

org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.SingleNormalClaimsGenerator=Generator for compound claims consisting of an array of independent, identically distributed claims. <br>The number <code>n</code> is obtained by summing all the frequencies received at the <code>inFrequency</code>-port in a given iteration.<br>A Normal distribution is used to generated the claims.<h4>See also:</h4><a href="resourceKey:org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.SimpleClaimsGenerator">SimpleClaimsGenerator</a>

org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.PoissonFrequencyGenerator=Generator for Poisson-distributed numbers.<h4>See also: </h4>

org.pillarone.riskanalytics.graph.formeditor.examples.ExcessOfLoss=Component for modeling the impact of excess of loss reinsurance which responds if an individual claim suffered by the insurer exceeds a certain amount (retention, priority or deductible). An example of this form of reinsurance is where the insurer is prepared to accept a loss of 1 million for any loss which may occur and they purchase a layer of reinsurance of 4 million in excess of 1 million. If a loss of 3 million occurs, then insurer will retain 1 million and will recover 2 million from its reinsurer. In this example, the reinsured will retain any loss exceeding 5 million unless they have purchased a further excess layer (second layer) of say 10 million excess of 5 million.<br>Different layers are modelled by different components. <h4>See also: </h4>
